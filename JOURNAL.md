## 11/2/2025 12 AM - Started following tutorial  

I created the project in KiCAD and started following the tutorial. I added the MCU to the schematic and I also added power decoupling and a USB C port.

## 11/2/2025 1:35 AM - Crystal Oscillator and Flash Storage  

Added the crystal oscillator part to the schematic which vibrates very precisely and acts as a clock signal.

Added flash storage to schematic. This uses SPI communication with the MCU being the master and the flash being the slave.

Spread them all out into connector pins

Organized and tidied up the schematic by adding boxes to separate each section.

## 11/3/2025 12 AM - Added footprints  

I assigned footprints for all of the basic parts like capacitors and resistors using SMD plates.

Looked through JLCPCB LCSC to figure out what parts to use. 
  

## 11/3/2025 9 AM - Added the rest of the footprints  

I originally thought I had to make my own footprints, so I spent a lot of time looking at the datasheets. Then I thought to ask people if I could just find the footprints on KiCAD and I did.
