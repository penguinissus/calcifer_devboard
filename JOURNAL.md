I created the project in KiCAD and started following the tutorial. I added the MCU to the schematic and I also added power decoupling and a USB C port.

## 11/2/2025 1 AM - Crystal Oscillator and Flash Storage  

Added the crystal oscillator part to the schematic which vibrates very precisely and acts as a clock signal.

Added flash storage to schematic. This uses SPI communication with the MCU being the master and the flash being the slave.
